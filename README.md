Hello my friend,

in doing the Odin-Project; right now I'm at the Recipes Project. 
The Foundation Course is going well. I'm really happy and look forward to get a better developer. 

This task was easy for me but I don't know, how to commit my project.


Also eigentlich kannte ich diese HTML Basics bereits, deshalb war das ganz entspannt!

Gruesseeeeee!
